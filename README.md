## About Audio Plugin Coder 

**Audio Plugin Coder (APC)** is the result of a long-standing personal obsession: building creative tools, writing music, and ultimately creating professional audio plugins.

While developing software instruments and effects has always been a dream, building real-world VSTs (with robust DSP, UI, state handling, and packaging) is notoriously complex. Over time, and especially with the rapid advancement of AI-assisted development, that barrier has finally crumbled.

Over the past 18 months, APC has been continuously designed, tested, and re-iterated as a practical **AI-first framework** for building audio plugins. This involved thousands of hours of experimentation, trial-and-error, and yes... occasionally yelling at LLMs to finally render the UI correctly.

**Midway through development, I stumbled upon the excellent work of [TÂCHES (glittercowboy)](https://github.com/glittercowboy).** His approach to context engineering was a revelation. I adopted some of his core ideas, particularly regarding meta prompting and structured agent workflows and integrated them directly into APC's DNA to create a more robust system.

APC is designed to be **Agent Agnostic**. Whether you use Google's Antigravity, Kilo, Claude Code, or Cursor, APC provides the structure they need to succeed.

## ⚠️ Development Status Disclaimer

**Audio Plugin Coder (APC) is currently in active development.** APIs may change, features may be incomplete, and bugs should be expected.

Use APC for development and experimentation purposes only until a stable release is announced.

## What is Audio Plugin Coder?

**Audio Plugin Coder (APC)** is a structured, AI-driven workflow system that guides LLM agents through the entire audio plugin development lifecycle.

It enables the creation of VST3 / AU / CLAP plugins using natural language, predefined workflows, and domain-specific skills- without constantly re-explaining context, architecture, or best practices to the AI.

Instead of manually juggling DSP architecture, UI frameworks, build systems, state tracking, and packaging, APC provides a unified framework where AI agents can operate with **long-term context, validation, and self-improving knowledge.**

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **LLM-Driven Development** - Designed to work with Antigravity, Kilo, Claude Code, Cursor, or any coding agent.
- 🎯 **Structured Workflows** - Five-phase system: Dream → Plan → Design → Implement → Ship.
- 🎨 **Dual UI Frameworks** - Choose Visage (pure C++) or WebView (HTML5 Canvas).
- 📊 **State Management** - Automatic progress tracking, validation, and rollback capabilities.
- 🔧 **Self-Improving** - Auto-capture troubleshooting knowledge; the system gets smarter over time.
- 🏗️ **Production Ready** - JUCE 9 integration with CMake build system.
- 📚 **Comprehensive Skills** - Pre-built domain knowledge for DSP, UI design, testing, and packaging.
- 🎬 **Bridge Templates** - FFGL visual plugins and Max/MSP externals support.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-command setup

No npm, no Node.js — just Git. Paste this into any terminal:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moonveiloco/audio-plugin-coder.git
cd audio-plugin-coder
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moonveiloco/audio-plugin-coder.git
cd audio-plugin-coder
bash scripts/system-check.sh   # verify your environment
```

> `--recurse-submodules` is mandatory: it pulls the JUCE 9 framework into `_tools/JUCE`. Without it the framework is missing and `/setup` will fail.

Then open the project in your AI coding agent and run `/setup` — it will ask where your plugins should live, verify the tools, and save `~/.config/apc/config.json`. Afterwards start your first plugin with `/dream MyPlugin`.

### Prerequisites

**Windows:** Windows 11, PowerShell 7+, Visual Studio 2022 (C++ tools), CMake 3.22+, Git

**macOS:** macOS 10.13+, Xcode + command line tools, CMake 3.22+, Git, jq (`brew install jq`)

**Linux:** CMake 3.22+, GCC/Clang, Git

**All platforms:** An LLM coding agent (Claude Code, Kilo, opencode)

### Bridge Templates (FFGL & Max/MSP)

If you are specifically interested in building **FFGL Visual Plugins** or **Max for Live Externals**, use the included One-Click Setup script for Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_bridges.bat
```

This script will:
1.  Check for CMake and Git.
2.  Automatically download JUCE 9 (if missing).
3.  Configure the Visual Studio solution for your chosen bridge.
4.  Open the project ready for compilation.

2. **Initialize your LLM agent:**

Skill, rules and workflows live in [`agents/`](agents/README.md) (single source of truth). Each supported agent reads them through its own shell:

- **Claude Code**: reads `CLAUDE.md` (imports `AGENTS.md` + `agents/rules/`), discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`
- **opencode**: reads `AGENTS.md` + `opencode.jsonc`, discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`, phase agents selectable with TAB in the TUI
- **Kilo Code**: reads `.kilocode/rules|skills|workflows/` (pointers to `agents/`)

After editing anything under `agents/`, regenerate the shells with:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-agent-pointers.sh && bash scripts/validate-agent-config.sh
```

3. **First Run Configuration:**

When you start the AI agent for the first time (e.g., type `/dream MyReverb`), the agent will detect that APC is not yet configured and will guide you through a short setup:

1. Choose a folder name for your plugins (e.g., `AudioPlugins` — will be created in your home directory)
2. The configuration is saved to `~/.config/apc/config.json` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%/apc/config.json` (Windows)

You can also manually trigger setup at any time:
```
/setup
```

4. **Create your first plugin:**
```
/dream MyReverb
```

The AI will guide you through the entire process!

## 📖 How It Works

### The Five-Phase Workflow

```
💭 DREAM (Ideation)
   ↓ Create creative brief, define parameters
   
📋 PLAN (Architecture)  
   ↓ Design DSP graph, select UI framework
   
🎨 DESIGN (GUI)
   ↓ Create mockups, iterate on visual design
   
💻 IMPLEMENT (Code)
   ↓ Build DSP engine, integrate UI
   
🚀 SHIP (Package)
   ↓ Build installers, test in DAWs
```

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dream [Name]` | Start new plugin with ideation phase |
| `/plan [Name]` | Define architecture and select UI framework |
| `/design [Name]` | Create GUI mockups and visual design |
| `/impl [Name]` | Implement DSP and UI code |
| `/ship [Name]` | Package and distribute plugin |
| `/status [Name]` | Check current progress and state |
| `/resume [Name]` | Continue development from last phase |
| `/new [Name]` | Run complete workflow with confirmations |

### Example Session

```
You: /dream TapeDelay

AI: Great! Let's define your plugin concept.

    What is the sonic character?
    (e.g., "Warm analog tape delay with wow/flutter")
    
You: Vintage tape echo with analog saturation

AI: Perfect! What are the top 3-5 parameters you want?

You: Delay time, feedback, wow/flutter amount, saturation, mix

AI: ✅ Dream phase complete!
    
    Files created:
    - $APC_PLUGINS_DIR/TapeDelay/.ideas/creative-brief.md
    - $APC_PLUGINS_DIR/TapeDelay/.ideas/parameter-spec.md
    - $APC_PLUGINS_DIR/TapeDelay/status.json
    
    Next step: /plan TapeDelay
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Self-Correction

APC uses a unique State Management system (status.json) to track development across phases. This allows you to pause, switch agents, or restart specific phases without losing context.

**User plugins** live outside the repo in `$APC_PLUGINS_DIR` (configured via `/setup`). Each plugin builds **inside its own folder**:
```
$APC_PLUGINS_DIR/
└── [YourPlugin]/
    ├── .ideas/              # Specs and planning
    ├── Design/              # UI mockups

    ├── build/               # Build artifacts (generated, per-plugin)
    └── status.json          # State tracking
```

### How Skills Work

**Skills** contain domain knowledge (the "how"):
- Step-by-step instructions
- Best practices
- Framework-specific guidance
- Code generation patterns

**Workflows** orchestrate skills (the "when"):
- Prerequisites validation
- Phase transitions
- State management
- Error recovery

**Example:** The `/design` workflow checks your UI framework selection (Visage or WebView) from `status.json`, then loads the appropriate design skill automatically.

## 🎨 UI Framework Options

### Visage (Pure C++) - Experimental
- Native C++ UI via Visage frames
- High performance, low overhead
- Full C++ control
- Custom rendering with `visage::Frame`

*Note: Visage integration is in active testing and may be unstable on some hosts.*

### WebView (HTML5 Canvas)
- Modern web technologies
- Rapid iteration with hot reload
- Rich component libraries
- Canvas-based rendering for performance

The AI helps you choose based on your plugin's complexity and requirements during the planning phase.

## 🔧 State Management

Every plugin has a `status.json` file tracking:
- Current development phase
- UI framework selection
- Completed milestones
- Validation checkpoints
- Error recovery points

**Benefits:**
- Resume development any time
- Validate prerequisites automatically
- Rollback on errors
- Track project history

## 🧠 Self-Improving Troubleshooting

APC includes an **auto-capture system** that learns from problems:

1. **AI encounters error** → Searches known issues database
2. **If known** → Applies documented solution immediately
3. **If unknown** → Attempts resolution, tracks attempts
4. **After 3 attempts** → Auto-creates issue entry
5. **When solved** → Documents solution for future use

**Location:** `agents/troubleshooting/`

**Result:** The system gets smarter with every issue encountered!

## 🤝 Compatible AI Agents

APC works with any LLM-based coding agent that supports:
- Custom workflows/slash commands
- File system access
- Shell execution (PowerShell on Windows, Bash on macOS/Linux)

**Tested with:**
- ✅ Claude Code (Anthropic)
- ✅ opencode
- ✅ Kilo (kilo.ai)
- [ ] Cursor
- [ ] Others welcome!

> **Agent config architecture:** skill, rules, workflows and the troubleshooting
> knowledge base live in [`agents/`](agents/README.md). The hidden folders
> (`.claude/`, `.kilocode/`) contain only generated pointers — add a new agent by
> extending `scripts/agent-homes.json` and running `scripts/sync-agent-pointers.sh`.

## 💖 Sponsor the Project

I am an independent developer pouring hundreds of hours (and significant API costs) into this project.

Developing a framework that works across different AI agents means constantly testing against paid tiers of Claude, Gemini, and others. I often run out of "Plan" usage just testing a single workflow improvement.

If APC saves you time, helps you learn JUCE, or helps you ship a plugin, please consider supporting the development. It helps cover API costs and accelerates new features!
